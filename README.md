# Key Access Program 

This program uses C++ classes and structs to create a user network, in which each user has 
personal information stored (ID number, password, name, personal key, and list of people 
they share their key with)
Each key has a message and a key number associated with it. In this program, new users can be 
created, removed, share keys with someone, and remove key access to someone. There is also a 
PANIC MODE option that allows users to remove everyone from their key sharing vector, only 
allowing them to use their keys. 

This program is meant to be a simulation of sharing a "key", which is a form of information, 
whether it be a message, password, or other important piece of information.
