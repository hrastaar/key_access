Key Access Program by Rastaar Haghi

This program uses C++ classes and structs to create a user network, in which each user has personal information stored (ID number, password, name, personal key, and list of people they share their key with)
Each key has a message and a key number associated with it. In this program, new users can be created, removed, share keys with someone, and remove key access to someone.
